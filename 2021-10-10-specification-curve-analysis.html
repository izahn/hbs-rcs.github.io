<div id="overview" class="section level2">
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Research reproducibility topic has been gaining momentum over the past decade. There have been many studies reporting inability to replicate published results and lack of necessary details in methods description. Some journals are addressing this issue by requiring access to study data and executable code. However, while this may provide some reassurance in reliability of the results, the actual choice of analytic methods could be shaped by many assumptions that might not be evident.</p>
<p>There usually isn’t one correct way to analyse data. Instead, empirical studies often have plenty of flexibility in the way data are collected and cleaned as well as in the final model specification. A data cleaning step may involve exclusion of some units with missing data or conversion of a continuous variable to a categorical one or (vice versa). There also might be models equally plausible for the outcome, but having different sets of covariates or functional forms. Each of these small steps may snowball into a reported effect that is overly favorable to researchers’ narrative.</p>
<p>A relatively novel and very promising method that can help to mitigate this issue was proposed in <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-simonsohn2015better" role="doc-biblioref">Simonsohn, Simmons, and Nelson</a> (<a href="#ref-simonsohn2015better" role="doc-biblioref">2015</a>)</span> and is called <strong>Specification Curve Analysis</strong> (SCA). The idea behind the method is simple - the researcher is asked to consider multiple plausible ways to analyze the data and show that, <em>jointly</em>, the null hypothesis of no effect can be rejected. It doesn’t mean that all models must result in a statistically significant effect (though, it would make the conclusions very convincing!). However, even if the effect is detected when all specifications are tested simultaneously, this would result in a more objective inference.</p>
</div>
<div id="method-details" class="section level2">
<h2>Method Details</h2>
<p>The method involves the following steps:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li>identifying the set of theoretically justified, statistically valid, and non-redundant analytic specifications;</li>
<li>running the analysis for each specification and displaying the results graphically - this allows the readers to identify consequential specification decisions;</li>
<li>conducting statistical tests to determine whether, as a whole, results are inconsistent with the null hypothesis.</li>
</ol>
<p>The first two steps above are self-explanatory. However, the third step is novel. The authors (<span class="citation"><a href="#ref-simonsohn2020specification" role="doc-biblioref">Simonsohn, Simmons, and Nelson</a> (<a href="#ref-simonsohn2020specification" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span>) proposed three test statistics for the SCA:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>median effect estimated across all specifications;</p></li>
<li><p>share of specifications that obtain a statistically significant effect in the predicted direction;</p></li>
<li><p>average of Z-values across all specifications.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>For each of them a sampling distribution can be generating by “resampling under-the-null.” This involves modifying the observed data so that the null hypothesis is known to be true, and then drawing random samples of the modified data. The test statistic of interest is then computed on each of those samples. The resulting distribution is the estimated distribution of the test statistic under the null.</p>

<h2>Available Tools</h2>
<p>There are several resources available to aid the implementation of the method. I organize them in a table below:</p>

</table>
<p>It looks like most major statistical programming language have some version of the specification curve implemented. However, as far as I can tell, none of them are capable of performing step (iii), which, arguably, is as important as the curve itself. Therefore, for now, researches have to implement it themselves or contact RCS (research@hbs.edu) for assistance!</p>

<div id="stata-example" class="section level2">
<h2>Stata Example</h2>
<p>Next, I show an example in Stata that loops through several model specifications and then uses the <a href="https://github.com/martin-andresen/speccurve">speccurve</a> function in Stata to plot the curve. Before running this code, make sure that the function is installed in Stata by running the following line:</p>
<p><code>net install speccurve, from("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/martin-andresen/speccurve/master")</code></p>
<p>The code uses a classic <code>auto</code> data set and specifies several regression models that predict car price using available characteristics. The effect of interest is the coefficient estimated for the indicator <code>foreign</code>.</p>
<pre class="stata"><code>clear all
sysuse auto, clear

loc no=0

* enumerationg many different specifications using a loop
foreach m in &quot;&quot; &quot;mpg&quot; {
    foreach tr in &quot;&quot; &quot;trunk&quot; {
        foreach wt in &quot;&quot; &quot;weight&quot; {
            foreach ln in &quot;&quot; &quot;length&quot; {
                foreach hr in &quot;&quot; &quot;headroom&quot; {
                    qui reg price foreign `m&#39; `tr&#39; `wt&#39; `ln&#39; `hr&#39;
                  eststo md`no&#39;
                    loc ++no
                }
            }
        }
    }
}

* plotting a SC with foreign as a parameter of interest

graph export &quot;speccurve1.svg&quot;, replace</code></pre>
<pre><code>(1978 Automobile Data)




(file speccurve1.svg written in SVG format)</code></pre>
<p>The code above produced the following specification curve:</p>
<p><img src="speccurve1.svg" /></p>
<p>Looks like including the <code>weight</code> variable in the model had a notable effect on the coefficient for <code>foreign</code>. Function <code>speccurve</code> is somewhat limited in that it doesn’t work with models that have factors as controls. Next, I show a workaround for the latter case:</p>
<pre class="stata"><code>clear all
sysuse auto, clear

egen headroom_c = group(headroom)
loc no=0

foreach m in &quot;&quot; &quot;mpg&quot; {
    foreach tr in &quot;&quot; &quot;trunk&quot; {
        foreach wt in &quot;&quot; &quot;weight&quot; {
            foreach ln in &quot;&quot; &quot;length&quot; {
                foreach hr in &quot;&quot; &quot;headroom&quot; &quot;i.headroom_c&quot;{
                    qui reg price foreign `m&#39; `tr&#39; `wt&#39; `ln&#39; `hr&#39;
                    
                    qui estadd scalar mpgv = 0, replace
                    qui estadd scalar trunkv = 0, replace
                    qui estadd scalar weightv = 0, replace
                    qui estadd scalar lengthv = 0, replace
                    foreach vr in m tr wt ln {
                        if &quot;``vr&#39;&#39;&quot;!=&quot;&quot; qui estadd scalar ``vr&#39;&#39;v = 1, replace
                    }
                    
                    qui estadd scalar headroomv = 0
                    qui estadd scalar iheadroom_cv = 0
                    local vname = subinstr(&quot;`hr&#39;&quot;, &quot;.&quot;, &quot;&quot;, .)
                    qui estadd scalar `vname&#39;v = 1, replace 
                    
                    eststo md`no&#39;
                    loc ++no
                }
            }
        }
    }
}

* The code below produces an error:
*speccurve *, param(foreign) controls title(SCA for the effect of foreigh)

* Workaround:
speccurve *, param(foreign) level(95) graphopts(legend(pos(1))) title(SCA for auto dataset) panel(mpgv trunkv weightv lengthv headroomv iheadroom_cv)
graph export &quot;speccurve2.svg&quot;, replace</code></pre>
<pre><code>(1978 Automobile Data)





(file speccurve2.svg written in SVG format)</code></pre>
<p>The code implements models that have <code>headroom</code> included as a factor or as a continuous variable. Note that the first call for <code>speccurve</code> would produce an error due to a bug in the function. However, the second call produces the following specification curve:</p>
