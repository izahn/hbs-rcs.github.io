The instructions below are adapted [this post](http://www.datasciencebytes.com/bytes/2015/12/18/using-jupyter-notebooks-securely-on-remote-linux-machines/). The key idea is to use ssh to connect a port on your local machine to a port on the remote machine. Because the grid uses LSF to run the Jupyter notebook on a back-end node we have to use this trick twice to connect your local machine to the front-end node, and the front-end node to the back-end node. Let's jump in...

1.  Connect to NoMachine (you could do this with two ssh connections if you prefer ssh).

2.  Open a terminal and start the Jupyter notebook on a back-end node using the following `bsub` command:

        bsub -app generic-5g -q interactive -Is jupyter notebook --no-browser

    Note what back-end node the Jupyter notebook is running on (this will be printed on the third line after your bsub command).
    
        Job <134879> is submitted to queue <interactive>.
        <<Waiting for dispatch ...>>
        <<Starting on rhrcsnod01>>
        
    In my case, the notebook is running on `rhrcsnod01`.
    
    Also note what port the Jupyter notebook is running at. In my case port 8888 was taken so it ended up running at on port 8889.
    
3.  Open a new terminal, use the `hostname` command to see what front-end node you are on. In my case, I am on `rhrcscli02`. Now use `ssh` to connect port 8889 on the back-end node to port 8889 on the front-end node:

        ssh -NL localhost:8889:localhost:8889 rhrcsnod01
        
4.  Now on your local machine, use `ssh` to connect port 8889 on your local machine to the port 8889 on the front-end node:

        ssh -NL localhost:8889:localhost:8889 rhrcscli02.hbs.edu
        
5.  Open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8889/ you should see the Jupyter notebook running on the grid!
